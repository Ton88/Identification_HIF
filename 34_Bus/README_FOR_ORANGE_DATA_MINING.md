# Replication of High Impedance Fault Experiment (34-Bus System)

## Overview

This repository contains the necessary files and instructions to replicate the High Impedance Fault (HIF) identification experiment using MATLAB Simulink, Wavelet transformations, and machine learning algorithms for a 34-bus system.

## Repository Structure

- **Simulink_Models**: Contains the Simulink models for the 34-bus system with high impedance faults.
- **Code**: MATLAB script `B34buss17.m` for generating the fault data after running the Simulink simulations.
- **Processed_Data**: CSV files generated from the MATLAB simulations and Wavelet transformations.
  - `Bus_34_20_s.csv`: Fault data generated by running `B34buss17.m`.
  - `Bus_34_mexh.csv` and `Bus_34_morl.csv`: Processed data using Wavelet transformations.
- **Wavelet_Transformations**: Jupyter notebooks to apply Wavelet transformations.
  - `mexh.ipynb`: Uses MEXH Wavelet for data processing.
  - `morl.ipynb`: Uses MORL Wavelet for data processing.
- **Orange_Workflows**: Pre-configured workflows for Orange Data Mining to train machine learning models for fault identification.
  - Algorithms: KNN, MLP, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM.

## How to Use

1. **Simulate the System**
   - Extract the Simulink model from the `Simulink_Models` folder (if available) and open it in MATLAB Simulink (version 2019b or compatible).
   - Run the simulation to generate fault data.
   - Use `B34buss17.m` to save the simulation results into `Bus_34_20_s.csv`.

2. **Wavelet Transformations**
   - Open `mexh.ipynb` and `morl.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Process the fault data and generate `Bus_34_mexh.csv` and `Bus_34_morl.csv`.

3. **Machine Learning Analysis**
   - Use Orange Data Mining software to open the workflows in the `Orange_Workflows` folder.
   - Train and test the models.

4. **Results and Analysis**
   - Evaluate the performance of each algorithm using the processed data.

## Requirements

- MATLAB Simulink (2019b or newer)
- Jupyter Notebook with Python 3.x
- Orange Data Mining software

## Notes

- Ensure you have all dependencies installed for running MATLAB scripts and Jupyter notebooks.
- Orange workflows are pre-configured; ensure the CSV files are correctly linked within the workflows.
